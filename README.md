# Food-Plus
Minecraft plugin that runs on Spigot/Paper (Minecraft Server API).

Simulate food/eating by listening to right click (EventListener) on certain blocks (stored in HashMap <Position, FoodData>).
Listen to placing blocks and adding them the the HashMap if they are the correct item (Head w/ custom skin).
